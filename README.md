This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Objective

This application was designed to test my understanding of Angular and components as a whole. We make use of a template from https://bootstrapious.com/. We change the code to create multiple components for each section of the webpage. (ie. Tags, SearchWidget, etc.)
